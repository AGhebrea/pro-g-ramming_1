# Requirements:
- The program should scan a folder, e.g ~/Downloads/ (source folder) and decide when it is time to move a file to a target folder
- The program should not spin at all times, e.g, when a file is added to source folder, it should do it's thing and then go back to sleep
- It should be able to actually download files.
- The purpose of this program is to optionally download a file and place it in a target folder depending on the file type OR scan a source folder and then when it is time (define this) move the file in target folder. 
- Should be able to run always in the background, w/o consuming resources when not needed.
